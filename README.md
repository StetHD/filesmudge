Smudge (actually break) a file so that it is detected as another type of file.

## examples
### _smudging_ a file
This example takes a Mach-O executable, and writes the 8 magic bytes to make it look like a `png`. The 8 bytes that orinally were in the file is backed up to a `test.bytes_backup` file.

### _restoring_ a file
It is possible to restore the file using _filesmudge_ too (assuming the `.bytes_backup` file is available)
